It was pet friendly which was great for our dog and had a mall that was walking distance. It was definitely the best beach experience I've ever had!</p>

We went to the Lourve to see the Mona Lisa and the Great Cathedral on a bus with two floors! Paris really is a place you must see!</p>

            <p>Being an amateur meteorologist myself with an avid interest in natural climate change, the events portrayed in TDAT are of course Hollywoodised and an accelerated version of what happens when an ice age strikes.

                Sure the lines are cheesy but the end message is one of hope. Humans are great at adapting and showing compassion when the situation fits. The special effects for the time were very impressive. I don't think I'll ever recover from that scene where the tidal wave strikes New York. It was awesome at the time and shows that a little bit of CGI goes a long, long way in making a film enjoyable (take note George Lucas, Disney, etc!)

                Unfortunately however, it makes no grounded, scientific and rational link to the fact that a drop in solar activity would result in violently displaced Jet Streams in both hemispheres and the onset of an ice age.

                But don't worry, your breath should offset the effects of the next ice age as it causes global warming apparently. Screaming teenage Swedes tell us so, therefore it must be true. On the other hand, CO2 is also a trace gas accounting for just 0.04% of our atmosphere and actually encourages plant growth with no bearing on world temperatures.

            <p>That mega earthquake was extremely epic though when they looked out the plane and saw a massive piece of land rising and falling into the sea as it tilts.

                All of the earthquakes were epic even the tsunamis the fire. That scene where they were going through that building almost crushed them kinda scared me a bit.

                The sad scene was the Indian scientist dying being the tsunami hit him and drowned. I really love this movie whenever it comes to epic scenes.
                Natural disaster movies always have the most epic scenes in my opinion.</p>
